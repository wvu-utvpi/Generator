#
# This script profiles the input program with sets of input systems that either modulate the number of variables, keeping the
# number of constraints constant; or modulate the number of constraints, keeping the number of variables constant. The feasibility
# input determines the set of input systems, based on the feasibility setting used to generate these systems, which does not
# correlate directly to the similarly-named "f" output that enters the empirical csv file.
#
# f0 input systems were generated with no guarantee of feasibility; none of the f0 input systems are linearly feasible. f1 input
# systems were generated with a guarantee of at least linear feasibility; one of these turned out to not be linearly feasible and
# about half of them are also integrally feasible. f2 input systems were generated with a guarantee of integral feasibility; one
# of these also turned out to not be linearly feasible, though the rest are integrally feasible.
#
# In the empirical csv file, an f value of 0 indicates a linearly infeasible system; an f value of 1 indicates a system that is
# linearly feasible, but not integrally feasible; and an f value of 2 indicates an integrally feasible system.
#
# A full profile of an input program would be completed by running this script with every combination of modify and feasibility.
# In some cases, these runs will each individually require a large amount of time, and/or a large amount of memory. This script
# was originally designed around being run in a screen session and will regularly print status information to the command line if
# run as a separate process with the ampersand.
#
# Any program profiled with this script must print feasibility and timing information to stdout or stderr, with commas delimiting
# separate values
#
# This script requires that all of these input files exist within an "input/" directory, and that "output/" and "empirical/"
# directories also exist within the current working directory.
