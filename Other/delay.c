/*
 * parseFile()
 *   A single function call to perform parsing of a UTVPI input file, facilitating the initialization and building of the calling
 *   system solver's representation of the system as the file is parsed
 * constraintFile - FILE pointer to a text file with the formatting specified above
 * object - void pointer, not used by this function, but passed back to the calling system solver as an argument to
 *   initializeSystem() and addConstraint(). Can be used to store a reference to an already-declared overall graph system struct,
 *   thereby avoiding the use of global variables
 * initializeSystem - pointer to a function within the calling system solver, used to initialize the solver's representation of
 *   the system, given the number of variables within the system
 *   object - same void pointer originally passed into parseFile()
 *   n - number of variables present within the system, as stated at the beginning of the UTVPI input file
 *   parser - Parser struct pointer, necessary when calling parseError()
 * addConstraint - pointer to a function within the calling system solver, used to add the given constraint to the solver's
 *   representation of the system
 *   object - same void pointer originally passed into parseFile()
 *   constraint - pointer to a Constraint struct, storing all information about a single constraint read from the UTVPI input file
 *   parser - Parser struct pointer, necessary when calling parseError()
 * returns true upon successful parse, false if any errors were encountered
